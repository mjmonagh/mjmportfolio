					<p>Urban Surf 4 Kids is a San Diego based, non-profit organization dedicated to helping orphan and foster youth through the joys of surfing and community service.  By hosting free surf camps and once-in-a-lifetime surf and serve trips, US4k helps give hope to disadvantaged youth.  I became a part of US4K in January 2015 and currently am the website manager for Urban Surf 4 Kids online magazine <a href="http://us4kmag.org">us4kmag.org</a> and the junior developer for <a href="http://us4k.org">us4k.org</a> (both Wordpress 4.1).  I am also the designer and manager for our promotional event website <a href="http://us4k.dojiggy.com">us4k.dojiggy.com</a>.  My duties include web design, custom css, search engine optimization, website security and content editing.

					<p>Days after graduating from Vanderbilt, I moved to San Francisco to work as an intern for Playnomics, a video and mobile gaming analytics company.  While at Playnomics, I operated as a member of both the Data Science and Business Development teams.  My regular duties included market research, customer network analysis, and onboarding customers.  In addition, one of the projects I am most proud of was helping to develop our use cases and pitch deck for casino and social casino games.  Accordingly, I researched pay schedules and forcasting algorithms and decided how we could best leverage our existing technologies to learn about users and maximize engagement and retention. I left Playnomics to begin advanced studies in computer science, in no small part due to my experiences and interaction with the engineering team there.  Playnomics was acquired by Unity Technologies in April 2014.
